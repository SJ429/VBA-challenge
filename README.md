# Stock Analysis with VBA 

A VBA script was used to analyze real stock market data in a Microsoft Excel workbook.

For this project, I created a VBA (Visual Basic) script to analyze some stock market data. 

There were three years (2014, 2015, and 2016) of data with each year in a different sheet inside the workbook.


The VBA script looped through all the stocks for one year for each run and took the following information:

1.  The ticker symbol

2.  Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year

3.  The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year

4.  The total stock volume of the stock

5.  Applied conditional formatting by highlighting positive yearly change values in green and negative yearly change values in red

6.  Returned the stock with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume
