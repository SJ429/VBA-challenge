# Stock Analysis with VBA 

A VBA script was used to analyze real stock market data in a Microsoft Excel workbook.

Background
For this project, I created a VBA (Visual Basic) script to analyze some stock market data. The data is inside a Microsoft Excel workbook and includes stock data for three years (2014, 2015, and 2016). Each year is a different tab/sheet inside the workbook.


It loops through all the stocks for one year for each run and takes the following information:

The ticker symbol

Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The total stock volume of the stock.

It applies conditional formatting by highlighting positive yearly change values in green and negative yearly change values in red.

Finally, it return the stock with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume
